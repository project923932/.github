## üîé Overview

The software bridges the gap between raw ECU data and practical performance adjustments. Instead of working with confusing hex values, DME Tuning translates engine parameters into clear maps and editable tables.

Its structured interface allows you to:

* Recognize critical engine maps instantly.
* Modify performance, fuel economy, or emissions balance.
* Flash optimized files safely back to the ECU.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Precision Map Editing:** Adjust torque, ignition, boost, and air/fuel ratios.
* **Live Data Logging:** Monitor RPM, pressure, and fuel trims in real time.
* **Multi-View Interface:** Switch between 2D curves, 3D surfaces, or raw HEX editing.
* **Automatic Checksum Correction:** Ensures safe ECU reprogramming.
* **Driver Library:** Pre-loaded templates for fast recognition of common ECUs.
* **Backup & Restore:** Protect against file corruption or failed flashes.
